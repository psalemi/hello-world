# hello-world
Standard Hello World introductory program

I am going to add some details about the project in this README file so that everyone will
understand what is going on. However, this is just for practice and so the README file will
end here. Thanks for listening and please enjoy the rest of your day.

I can't believe I have to write more stuff on this file as an example. Why can't I just
stop writing, please!
